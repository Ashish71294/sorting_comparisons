# sorting_comparisons
In this Repository We have three Sorting Algorithms with comparison counter. Sorting Algorithms are those in which we can sort the numbers with different methods or forms.Plot a graph of number of inputs and number of comparisons Inputs varies from 10 ,20,50,100...1000 and every series of different inputs  must executes 10 times .From that graph we had better understanding on the sorting algos. Quick sort and Merge sort are both equivalent on some stage and differ in procedure .Insertion sort is sorting algo in which we compare every number to the other as small number come on the front side and large on the other .Merge sort algo based on the Divide conquer method and Quick on pivot compare . After analysis ,We got the results as which algo is effective in variation of numbers.
